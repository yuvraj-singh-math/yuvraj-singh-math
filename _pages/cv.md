# Experience
## Research Internship (Durham, UK)
### Durham University (June 2024 - September 2024)
- Summer research internship supervised by Dr Yue Ren in tropical geometry, resulting in a [paper on arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00156).
- Studied embedding polynomial systems into vertically parametrised systems for use of the properties of their tropical variety (*e.g.* providing the generic number of points on a zero-dimensional complex variety).
- Developed and now maintain an unofficial interface [OscarODEbase](https://github.com/yuvraj-singh-math/OscarODEbase) for [ODEbase](https://www.odebase.org/) to be used with computer algebra system OSCAR.
- Constructed a greedy algorithm to produce such an embedding.
## Mathematical Problem Solving Society (Durham, UK)
### Treasurer (October 2024 - Present)
- Responsible for managing finances in the society.
- Keep financial records, handle funding from sponsorships and the Durham Student Union.
- Involved in organising math competitions hosted at Durham, \textit{e.g.} Integeration Bee. 
- Assisted in hosting weekly problem solving sessions, which are accessible for non-mathematics students while still being challenging for mathematics students as well.
## International Conference on Mathematic Software (Durham, UK)
### Local Organiser (July 2024)
- Assisted speakers in setting up talks.
- Attended talks on computational aspects of algebraic and tropical geometry.
